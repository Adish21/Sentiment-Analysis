https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8632n81dx3o,"Freed Israeli hostage was unaware wife and daughters killed, British family says","An Israeli hostage freed from Gaza did not know his wife and daughters were killed in the 7 October attack until after his release on Saturday, his British family said. Eli Sharabi was taken by Hamas 16 months ago andreleased on Saturdayin Deir al-Balah, in Gaza. His wife Lianne Sharabi, who was from Bristol, and daughters Noiya and Yahel were found murdered in their safe house""cuddled together""in 2023. Lianne's parents Gill and Pete Brisley told the BBC on Sunday that an Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) soldier told Mr Sharabi what happened to his family. His relatives had been unsure whether Mr Sharabi knew that Lianne, Noiya and Yahel - Mr and Mrs Brisley's daughter and grandchildren - were killed in the 7 October attack. He wasone of three hostages handed to the Red Cross by Hamasin a choreographed release on Saturday as part of aninternationally brokered ceasefire deal. Speaking on stage during his release, Mr Sharabi said he was ""very happy today to return to... my wife and daughters"", adding to concerns that he was unaware of what happened to them. Mr and Mrs Brisley said Mr Sharabi was ""lucid"" and his ""voice a bit husky"" when they spoke later on a video call. ""He got choked up a couple of times but managed a small smile for us. Such a brave man,"" said the couple who are due to fly out to see him soon. Mr and Mrs Brisley, who live in Bridgend, south Wales, said they cried watching their son-in-law's release on a livestream. They said Mr Sharabi's face looked ""gaunt"". Mr Brisley said it left them ""a bit wobbly"" and it was a ""very emotional morning"". He said: ""When we saw Eli it was to see the emaciated state that they've put him in. ""Eli's got quite a chubby face normally. You see the film of him with hollow eyes, sunken cheeks and his wrists were sticks."" Mrs Brisley said: ""Seeing Eli come out now, it brought everything back. [We] sat and bawled our eyes out. ""I was sitting there cuddling Lianne's teddy bear. I think I made him wet actually. It reminded us of what we lost."" ""The only thing that keeps us going is the fact we know Eli is back. At least there's one member of our very close family that is still alive,"" Mrs Brisley said. ""[We're] grateful to him for our two beautiful granddaughters, didn't have them for long enough. We need now to concentrate on all of the happy times. ""So we live in our memories, that's all we can do. Think about them, talk about them, and make sure nobody forgets them."" Mr Brisley said: ""We hope to be a part of getting him back to some sort of normal."" Lianne grew up in Staple Hill, on the outskirts of Bristol, and first moved to Israel as a volunteer on a kibbutz when she was 19, before relocating to the country permanently. After just three months in Israel, she met Eli. They had two daughters, Noiya and Yahel, who were 16 and 13 when they were killed. One of Eli's brothers, Yossi, was also taken hostage on 7 October, but was later killed in captivity. Hamas said his death was the result of an Israeli airstrike, which Israel said was likely. Another of the hostages freed on Saturday, Or Levy, also learned upon his release that his wife was killed by Hamas during the attack in which he was abducted, his brother said. Michael Levy told journalists: ""For 491 days, he [Or] held on to the hope that he would return to her. For 491 days, he didn't know she was no longer alive."" He said his brother was ""alive"" and ""here"", but their family's ""happiness is mixed with an immense sadness, a pain that cannot be described"". The release of the three hostages comes underthe ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, which came into effect on 19 January. Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners on Saturday. The ceasefire deal will see a total of 33 hostages taken on 7 October released in weekly hand-overs in exchange for 1,900 Palestinians in Israeli prisons. So far, 16 Israeli hostages have been freed and 566 prisoners have been released since the ceasefire began. On 7 October Hamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel, triggering the war. At least 47,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says. Follow BBC Bristol onFacebook,XandInstagram.

https://m.economictimes.com/articles/articlelist/30990540.cms,Articles,"The telecom industry has entered the age of ""new data."" What does it mean? How is ""new data"" different from traditional data? Well, while data is not a new concept for telecom service providers and has been around for years (a couple of decades to say so), it's only in the recent years that it's been slipping out telcos' control. A fact of the matter is that data growth in the recent years, especially after 3G tariffs were slashed by up to 80 percent, has been unprecedented. Telecom is the vertebral nervous system for today’s business and social environment. For an industry that makes all connectivity possible, its relationship with consumers becomes a very important parameter while choosing a service provider in an environment as competi-tive as India. Networked Society 'case studies' Ericsson , a world leader in Communications technology and services  has released a new “Networked Society Stories” campaign on TV on a global basis after many  years. India, the “Smart” in Smart Cities is indicative of planning and implementation of sustainable cities with thought-through, efficient public transport, water systems, amenities and communication facilities. The role of IT is not just limited to keeping the lights on. IT is also responsible to continuously provide solutions to enhance the business capabilities and to support business processes. The business world is currently moving into an era of  ubiquitous connectivity, which is transforming the operating styles and communication channels of an enterprise. Telecom operators are hard pressed to find new ways to improve their revenue and profits with commoditization of voice and broadband services, and declining revenue-per-bit as a result of rapid growth in social media and OTT services. In India, the government’s focus on building 100 smart cities in the country has created a lot of buzz on the subject . It is a welcome move for countries and states to think in this direction and  will ensure better citizen services in the digital economy which is all set to unfold. Mobility is increasingly becoming part of our everyday life triggered by the need to be ‘always connected’. India, the second largest telecom market in the world, is often seen as a goldmine of potential opportunity. However, one cannot overlook the tremendous amounts of constraints surrounding this massive opportunity – significantly low average revenue per user (ARPU), high churn, low entry and exit barriers, highly expensive spectrum acquisition bids, etc 3G has made some rapid strides in the recent quarters in India and there is no doubt that smartphones with ever lower price points have been a key growth catalyst so far. A new government is in place, investments are poured in from companies like Reliance and most importantly, international collaborations are being encouraged. Bharti Airtel has started investing in Self Organising Networks (SON) to tackle capacity issues and improve overall customer experience We are progressing towards a new society, packed with endless possibilities and opportunities, a society where everything that can benefit from a connection will be connected. We call this new emerging society – Networked Society. For any consumer, it is a highly personalized device which is always on. This device is capable of fulfilling a whole range of needs catering to voice, internet, VAS, mobile banking, social media etc. 'Bad things are going to happen to Iran if...': Trump warns Iran Ukranian President Zelenskyy cautious on new minerals deal VP Vance on why does Greenland matter so much Alina Habba takes over as US Attorney for New Jersey 'Had extremely productive call with Canada PM' Shocking details of Tesla vandalism in Las Vegas out Myanmar earthquake| Horrendous visuals emerge from Mandalay city 'Won’t stop': Kash Patel on arrest of MS-13 gang leader Putin calls for Zelenskyy’s removal Trump’s auto shock, BSE surges as NSE stumbles Russia’s show of power in Arctic 'India ready to offer assistance': PM on Myanmar, Thailand Earthquake 7.3 magnitude earthquake shakes Bangkok Hot on Web In Case you missed it Top Searched Companies Top Calculators Latest News Follow us on:",Positive

""...such cases are being investigated as hate crimes,"" the minister told the Lok Sabha in a written reply on Friday. Kirti Vardhan Singh all incidents of attack and desecration of temples and places of worship in the US are immediately taken up with the US government through diplomatic channels. ""The respective temple management authorities and the community associations have also registered complaints with the local law enforcement authorities and have called for proper investigations, and stringent action against those responsible for these acts, and for providing the places of worship with adequate safety and security arrangements,"" Kirti Vardhan Singh said. The minister's reply stated, ""The law enforcement authorities have conveyed that such cases are being investigated as hate crimes. Members of the US Congress have also urged the concerned agencies to come up with a broader strategy to counter hate crimes targeting Hindus in the United States."" Incidents of defacement of Hindu temples have also been reported in Canada and Bangladesh. India earlier expressed deep concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Bangladesh, particularly regarding the safety of minorities. Between August 2024 and February 2025, over 2,374 incidents were reported, but the police verified only 1,254 of them, with 98 per cent deemed ""political in nature"". In November 2024, an Indian consular camp at the Hindu Sabha Temple in Canada's Brampton witnessed a ""violent disruption"" on Sunday in Brampton, near Toronto. The incident sparked widespread criticism in and outside Canada. India has repeatedly expressed its deep concern about extremism and the culture of violence and anti-India activities in Canada and has asked Canadian authorities to take action against these activities.

As India grows, HMIL will continue to grow intrinsically with it, along with a constant focus on driving innovation, improving operational efficiencies, and making strategic investments that will strengthen our business outlook and contribute to the growth of the Indian economy,"" said Unsoo Kim, Managing Director – HMIL. National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) has included Hyundai Motor India Limited in its coveted NIFTY Next 50 index, Broad Market Indices & Thematic Indices. In the recent Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) rejig which took place on February 28, 2025, HMIL was the only large cap from India to be included to the MSCI Global Standard Index.

The auto stock is now showing signs of a lower high formation, indicating potential weakness.

In a candid BTS (behind-the-scenes) video from the set, the Shark Tank India judge shared his ‘report card’ and said some responses made him feel like a “straight-A student”. In an Instagram reel, a longer version of which was shared on YouTube, Ritesh Agarwal said, “This Felt Like Checking My Report Card After Exams...”  Thinking out loud, the Oyo founder said, “On Shark Tank India, we tell entrepreneurs what’s working and what’s not. But today, I decided to put myself in the hot seat and ask the crew and my fellow Sharks what THEY think of me.”  Although worried about whether the video was a “big mistake?” Ritesh said, “Some responses had me feeling like a straight-A student.” The Shark Tank India set was all praise forOyo founder Ritesh Agarwal, who they said is a “very good listener”, as some even considered him one of their favourites among the ‘Sharks’. Nitya, a crew member atShark Tank India, said her favourite thing about the Oyo founder is the constant, reassuring smile on Ritesh's face during the pitches. “During the pitches, he has a constant smile on his face. That makes it very engaging for the pitcher,” she said, adding that it helps reassure the contestant that he is interested in knowing about their brand. Another member from the set, Ridhi, said Ritesh is a “very encouraging Shark” on the panel of judges. “Even if he's not into investing, he will encourage the pitcher,” she said. Rishi also added that the Oyo founder takes an interest in how the business of the contestant became what it is today, which she finds endearing. “He is very interested in knowing the personal story of the businesses,” she said. Vishesh Garg, a coordinator for theSharks, said Ritesh is “very punctual” and “sorted”. Vishesh shared that his favourite thing about the Oyo founder is how he treats people; “even though I work for him, he makes it feel like I'm working with him”. Jalpa said Ritesh is one of her “favourites at Shark Tank”, and deemed him as a “good listener” who is “very motivating”. She said she loves the way the Oyo founder treats pitchers on Shark Tank India. Princy said, ""Ristesh is very humble and a very good advisor. “When pitchers come to the show, he is very humble and gives them advice. He, very humbly, tells the pitcher if there are any mistakes in their pitch. I really like him as an investor.” Catch all theBusiness News,Corporate news,Breaking NewsEvents andLatest NewsUpdates on Live Mint. Download TheMint News Appto get Daily Market Updates.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/blackstone-buyout-fund-is-closing-late-below-earlier-goals-11743200548153.html,"Blackstone Buyout Fund Is Closing Late, Below Earlier Goals","(Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Inc.’s protracted campaign to raise cash for its flagship buyout fund is finally grinding to a close, beyond schedule and billions of dollars short of initial expectations. The firm, which began seeking capital in 2022, told investors it will have wrapped up fundraising around the end of March with a little more than $21 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential details. Buyout funds that closed in the past year took about half as much time on average. Blackstone declined to comment. High borrowing costs have dented the confidence of pension funds and other big investors in private equity’s traditional playbook: buying companies with debt and cashing out at a profit. Industry fundraising declined in 2024 for the third straight year, according to a February report by McKinsey & Co. Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative-asset manager, wasn’t spared. It began preparing for the fundraising shortly before the Federal Reserve began ratcheting up interest rates to combat surging inflation. The firm faced a crowded field just as institutions had less cash on hand. After telling investors that it planned to complete fundraising by the first half of 2023, Blackstone told them it needed more time and pushed back the schedule to the second half, and then kept the fund open for stragglers. The firm also tempered expectations about how much it planned to raise. Bloomberg initially reported in late 2021 that the firm could seek as much as $30 billion. In 2023, Blackstone suggested it would collect about $25 billion, on par with its prior fund. By the start of last year, Blackstone said its target was at least $20 billion. Blackstone, led Chief Executive Officer Steve Schwarzman and his heir-apparent, President Jon Gray, now has another challenge: showing that big buyouts can still deliver market-beating returns as elevated interest rates and President Donald Trump’s trade war threaten a deal revival. Private equity was Blackstone’s second-largest business by assets after credit and insurance at the end of last year. In a recent change in the buyout team’s leadership, Joe Baratta ceded day-to-day management of the flagship vehicle to oversee all private equity strategies. That paved the way for Martin Brand to take over as the fund’s new chief. Buyout firms have been struggling to return capital to investors, giving pensions and endowments even less cash to plow back into new funds. Investors became more choosy, taking a harder look at firms’ returns to parse whether they got there because of skill, financial engineering, or dumb luck. Blackstone’s last buyout fund, which began investing in 2020, ranked in the bottom quartile among peers by internal rate of return, according to MSCI buyout fund data through September. An earlier fund that started doing deals in 2016 landed in the third quartile. Both funds were in the second quartile by a different measure of returns. As the fundraising dragged on, some investors drove a tough bargain on fees and terms. In response to some clients’ concerns, Blackstone executives signaled that the firm doesn’t expect to do any deals involving patient-facing health-care businesses in the US, the people said. Big private equity firms were hurt by lackluster performance in that sector and invited scrutiny about whether they’re valuing profit over patients’ well-being. Blackstone also changed how it allocates deals between funds. Earlier vintages of its global buyout fund invested alongside every deal from its Asia fund and another energy fund. The latest flagship vehicle will only invest alongside the biggest energy and Asia deals. The move creates sharper delineations between the funds’ risks and returns. In combination, the three private equity strategies are expected to bring in more capital than was raised in their last vintage. Blackstone plans to raise more than $10 billion for its next Asia fund. Its $5.6 billion energy fund wound up larger than its predecessor. The firm has told investors that having capital at hand will help it take advantage of a market rebound. In 2024, Blackstone made the first investment for the flagship buyout fund with the acquisition of Tropical Smoothie Cafe. It also backed sandwich chain Jersey Mike’s. During Blackstone’s fourth-quarter earnings conference call in January, Gray said the tenor of the discussions with clients around traditional funds are “feeling far better than it has in several years.” (Updates with Asia fundraising plans in third-to-last paragraph.)

https://www.livemint.com/companies/company-results/trumps-pick-for-wall-street-prosecutor-will-keep-apollo-stock-11743196168585.html,Trump’s Pick for Wall Street Prosecutor Will Keep Apollo Stock,"President Donald Trump’s pick to police Wall Street’s financial crimes plans to hang onto holdings in Apollo Global Management, American Express and a digital asset platform, according to documents released Friday by the Office of Government Ethics. Jay Clayton, the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer Trump selected to serve as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, disclosed his assets, clients and financial stakes in the documents. Clayton, 58, joined Apollo’s board in 2021 following co-founder Leon Black’s decision to step down as CEO as he faced scrutiny over his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But rather than sell off his stake in the private equity giant and a handful of other companies he had close business relationships with, Clayton has opted to recuse himself should matters involving them cross his desk as the top prosecutor in a district that oversees Wall Street. Clayton, who was Trump’s chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the president’s first term, will resign his position at Apollo, his law firm and other companies when he’s confirmed by the Senate, according to his ethics agreement that spells out the steps he’ll take to remove conflicts of interest. He’ll also step down from American Express’ board of directors, and as an adviser to digital asset platform Fireblocks, Inc. He’s already resigned from some positions, including a senior adviser role at Coinbase Asset Management, an investment firm owned by the cryptocurrency exchange with the shared name. But he’s not selling off his holdings in some of those companies, his ethics agreement says. Clayton will also continue to have equity stakes in Fireblocks and accounting and advisory firm CFGI LLC. Clayton will hold onto his common Apollo stock, but divest a capital commitment for a fund for employees. He said he will sell his interests in more than 20 other companies, including Apple Inc., Bank of America Corp., GE Electric Co. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. The assets he’s retaining that will require him to recuse from some matters are worth at least $2.6 million, according to the filing. Overall, Clayton disclosed holdings worth at least $33.9 million. Nominees value their assets in broad ranges. Because of his position as US attorney, federal rules don’t require Clayton to divest all his holdings as is required by cabinet officials and other political jobs, said attorney Stan Brand, an expert in ethics law. “As long as he’s not participating in issues or cases that relate to his investments,” Brand said, “there’s not an issue.” New York’s Southern District handles many high-profile financial fraud cases, as well as those alleging terrorism, organized crime and public corruption. They include the prosecutions of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Archegos Capital Management’s Bill Hwang, both convicted of fraud. US attorneys, who prosecute civil and criminal cases for the federal government, are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate. If confirmed, Clayton will forgo some of the perks from his past roles. Sullivan & Cromwell offers retired partners office space and secretarial services at the firm’s expense, while Apollo lets retired directors the right to invest in its sponsored funds. Clayton won’t take advantage of those benefits for the duration of his time in office, according to his disclosure. With assistance from Bill Haubert. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/oracle-warns-health-customers-of-patient-data-breach-11743202066627.html,Oracle Warns Health Customers of Patient Data Breach,"(Bloomberg) -- Hackers broke into Oracle Corp.’s computer systems and stole patient data in an attempt to extort multiple medical providers in the US, according to a person familiar with the matter and a notification the software company sent to clients. Earlier this month, Oracle alerted some health-care customers that sometime after Jan. 22, hackers accessed company servers and copied patient data to an outside location, according to the notification, which was seen by Bloomberg News. Oracle sells software for patient records management to hospitals, doctors’ groups and other medical companies. The FBI is investigating the breach and the attempts by cyberattackers to force medical companies to pay ransoms, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. It’s unknown how many patients’ records were taken. The total number of health-care providers that the hackers have sought to extort is also uncertain. Oracle, based in Austin, Texas, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. In 2022, Oracle acquired the electronic health records business Cerner Corp. for $28 billion and touted goals to modernize the legacy software company, including by moving customers to the cloud. Customers include large hospitals chains, small clinics and government-run facilities. The purchase came with a flagship $16 billion contract with the US Department of Veterans Affairs, which has seen highly-publicized outages and lawmaker scrutiny. Oracle told customers that the hackers accessed older Cerner servers, taking data that had not yet been shifted to Oracle’s cloud storage service, according to the notice. “Available evidence suggests the threat actor illegally accessed the environment by using stolen customer credentials,” the company said in the notice. Oracle said it became aware of the breach around Feb. 20. The notice to customers states that the stolen data may have included patient information from electronic medial records. The person familiar with the breach said the material taken included recent patient records. “Oracle will support your organization in its review of information to identity impacted patients” the company told clients. The publication Bleeping Computer reported earlier on some of the details of the cyberattack. --With assistance from Julie Zhu.

The move will likely benefit 1.15 crore central government employees and pensioners. ""The Cabinet has approved the release of anadditional instalment of DAto central government employees and DR to pensioners with effect from January 1, representing an increase of two per cent over the existing rate of 53 per cent of the basic pay/pension, to compensate against price rise, said Ashwini Vaishnaw, Minister of Information and Broadcasting after the meeting. Also Read:Push for electronics production, sops for central govt staff With this revision, DA will rise from 53 per cent to 55 per cent, providing a salary boost for employees ahead of the anticipated 8th Pay Commission. The government's 8th Pay Commission, which the Centre approved in January, revised the wages and allowances of central government employees. Earlier, the DA was hiked by three per cent in October and four per cent in March 2024. The combined impact on the exchequer due to an increase in both DA and DR would be₹6,614.04 crore per annum. The move will benefit 48.66 lakh central government employees and 66.55 lakh pensioners. Also Read:DA Hike: THIS state govt announces increase in Dearness Allowance by 4% The increase is per the accepted formula of the rate, which is based on the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission. DA and DR is paid to adjust the cost of living and protect employees and pensions from inflation. Dearness Allowance is a financial benefit provided to government employees to offset inflation and ensure their salaries remain in line with rising living costs. While basic salaries are determined by a pay commission every 10 years, DA ensures periodic adjustments to help employees manage inflation. This is the first DA hikeafter the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission. The government had announced the formation of the 8th Pay Commission on January 16, 2025, which will come into effect from January 1, 2026. The government increases DA twice a year. The biannual revision of the DA rate is calculated as per the All India Consumer Price Index (Industrial Workers) reading for January and December. It serves as a key metric to determine the rate at which DA and DR are hiked. The index serves a key gauge to measure the impact of inflation on industrial workers.
